\# Connect Four Game (React)

A simple **Connect Four** game built with **React** where two players (Player 1 and Player 2) take turns dropping tokens (red or yellow) into a 7×6 grid, aiming to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four tokens.

## Features

1. **Two-Player Turns** – Player 1 (red) and Player 2 (yellow) alternate turns.
2. **Lowest Available Slot** – Tokens always occupy the lowest available row in the selected column, just like real Connect Four.
3. **Winning Logic** – (Optional or in progress) You can implement horizontal, vertical, or diagonal checks to detect the winning condition.
4. **React Hooks** – Uses React’s state management (`useState`) for board updates.
